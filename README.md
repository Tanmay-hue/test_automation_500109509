# Backend API Test Automation üöÄ

This project offers a robust framework for API testing on a FastAPI backend. It leverages pytest for automated testing, integrates with GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and includes performance testing and comprehensive reporting tools.

---

## Project Overview üõ†Ô∏è

### What It Does

- **FastAPI Backend**: Implements a REST API with endpoints for arithmetic operations, complete with validation and error handling.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses pytest with parameterized tests, covers edge cases, and integrates Allure reporting.
- **Performance Testing**: Employs Locust to simulate concurrent users, measuring response times and system performance.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated workflows using GitHub Actions streamline testing, reporting, and deployment.

### Troubleshooting & Resolutions

During initial GitHub Actions runs, several issues were identified and resolved:

1. **Workflow File Errors**
   - **Issue**: "Invalid workflow file: .github/workflows/TestAutomation.yml#L18"
   - **Resolution**: Split multiple `run` commands into separate steps and corrected YAML formatting.

2. **Outdated Action Version**
   - **Issue**: "Missing download info for actions/upload-artifact@v2"
   - **Resolution**: Upgraded to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`.

3. **Test Execution Failures**
   - **Issue**: "Process completed with exit code 2"
   - **Resolution**: Added missing dependencies (`httpx`, `starlette`) and fixed import issues.

4. **Artifact Directory Not Found**
   - **Issue**: "No files were found with the provided path: ./allure-results"
   - **Resolution**: Introduced a step to create the `allure-results` directory before running tests.

## Key Components

### 1. API Server (apiserver.py) üåê

- Developed using FastAPI to provide REST endpoints.
- Handles arithmetic operations with robust input validation.
- Auto-generates API documentation.

### 2. Test Suite (automation_test_pytest.py) üß™

- Contains parameterized and edge case tests.
- Validates error handling and includes performance benchmarks.
- Integrates with Allure for detailed reporting.

### 3. Performance Testing (performance_test.py) üöÄ

- Utilizes Locust to simulate concurrent user traffic.
- Monitors response times and performance metrics.
- Provides insights into system behavior under load.

### 4. Configuration (config.py) ‚öôÔ∏è

- Manages environment-specific settings.
- Configures base URLs, timeouts, and test parameters.
- Enables flexible configuration for diverse deployment environments.
